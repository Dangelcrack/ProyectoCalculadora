# Pokemon Damage Calculator Project

This project implements a damage calculator in Java that allows calculating the damage two Pokémon would inflict on each other in a battle. The calculator takes into account various factors, such as the types of the Pokémon, their statistics, moves, and additional effects.

## Key Features

- **Damage Calculation**: Allows calculating the damage a Pokémon would inflict on another using different moves.
- **Pokemon Types**: Considers the effectiveness of Pokémon types in the damage calculation.
- **Pokemon Statistics**: Utilizes attack, defense, special attack, and special defense statistics to calculate damage.
- **Pokemon Moves**: Permits selecting specific moves and their effects to calculate resultant damage.
- **Graphical User Interface (Optional)**: Potential to implement a graphical user interface for a more intuitive experience.
